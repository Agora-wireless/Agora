## General Guidelines

1. Source code is formatted in a style derived from the "WebKit" style, and enforced by clang-format.  Running "clang-format -i $file" for a newly modified file will format it to match proper code style.
2. Before commit new changes, make sure 
* source code compiles without warnings; 
* apply "clang-format -i $file" to modified files.
