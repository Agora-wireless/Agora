I've seen two different seemingly intractable
approaches for constructing signals corresponding
to certain channel bandwidths. The first is using the
tables provided by the industry. Eg. For a signal with
a 5 MHz channel bandwidth with a 15 kHz subcarrier spacing 
it is advised to use a FFT size of 512.

However it is also shown that the channel bandwidth can be
calculated as CBW = N_RB * subcarrier_num_per_RB * SCS + 2 GB.
N_RB * subcarrier_num_per_RB = total num of subcarriers

When I run a build a config on Agora the terminal output tells
me that the subcarrier_num_per_RB is the same as the size I specified
for the FFT size in the config file. 

Following this logic to its conclusion, if I plug 512 into the equation 
defined above for calculating CBW, I get:

CBW = 512*15 kHz + 2*(242.5 kHz) where SCS = 15kHz and GB = 242.5 kHz min for a
5 MHz CBW symbol.

But based on this calculation CBW = 8.1 Mhz.

Even for just calculating the maximum transmission bandwidth of a signal
which is defined as TBW = 7.7 mHz.

Now I could calculate the number of subcarriers needed to achiee exact 
CBW and TBW, but I get values for my fft like 300, etc and I'm not sure if that'same
right. the question is how to reconscile these two seemingly contradictory methods.
