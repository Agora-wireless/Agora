/**
 * @brief Implementations of this class provide packet I/O for Agora clients (UEs).
 *
 * In the vanilla mode, this class provides socket packet I/O for communicating
 * with channel simulator.
 *
 * In the "Argos" mode, this class uses SoapySDR-based functions (from client_radio.cpp)
 * to communicate with Agora client wireless hardware. Since clients require over-the-air
 * time synchronization with Agora BS, this class provides two types of functions
 * for this purpose:
 * 1) TX/RX with hardware-offloaded synchronization (loop_tx_rx_argos) where sync happens
 *    in the wireless hardware, where only downlink symbols' samples are received (guard
 *    symbols are discarded in hardware) and uplink symbols are sent to the wireless
 *    hardware to be sent at the correct time w.r.t BS.
 * 2) software-based syncronization (loop_tx_rx_argos_sync) where all of sychronization
 *    and time-keeping w.r.t. BS happens in this function as well as downlink and uplink
 *    receive and transmit functions.
